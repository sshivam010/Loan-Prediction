# Loan-Prediction
This is a practice hackathon. We have dataset with information about customers and the goal is to predict whether the company should give them loans or not.

At first I do some qui—Åk modelling to see what features are important. Then I do data exploration to get some insights and fill missing values. The prediction is done using RandomForest.
